Breakdown of Key Components:
backend: This directory contains all server-side logic. It includes configuration files, middleware, models, routes, and controllers. The services folder is used for business logic, while utils contains helper functions that may be used across multiple parts of the application.
contracts: This folder holds the Solidity smart contract, which defines the functionality of the Palestine Donation Token.
scripts: Contains deployment scripts to help automate the process of deploying smart contracts to the blockchain network. In this case, deploy.js is responsible for deploying the PalestineDonationToken.sol contract.
test: This directory is reserved for testing the smart contract logic using frameworks like Mocha or Chai.
